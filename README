NAME
    qn - Perl extension for quoting and splitting on newlines.

SYNOPSIS
      use qn;

      @a = qn <<END;
          word
          word with spaces
          another word
      END

      @b = qn '
          element one
          element two
      ';

      @c = qn "
          item: $one
          item: $two
      ";

DESCRIPTION
    Quoting similar to qw//. Instead of splitting on whitespace though, qn
    splits on newlines allowing each element to include whitespace.

    Leading and trailing whitespace is stripped from each element, but
    whitespace within is left intact.

CAVEATS
    *   Won't work with delimiters such as ()'s, {}'s, or //'s.

    *   End tag must be fully outdented in here-doc usage. But that's a Perl
        thing, right?

EXPORT
    qn()
